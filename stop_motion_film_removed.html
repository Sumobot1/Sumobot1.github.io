                    <h2 class="white">Stop Motion Lego Film</h2>
                    <p>In my Grade 10 history class, one of my projects was to investigate Prohibition in the USA in the 1920s. I chose to do this by making a stop motion Lego film. My friend and I made sets out of Lego, and then alternated between taking pictures and changing positions. I also wanted to add a Star Trek element to the video, so I took some pictures of my Mega Blocks model of the Enterprise D. Each slide was created manually in Powerpoint. I then edited the video together using Adobe Premier Elements. My family and I did the voice acting on the project. The video is quite long, so I have taken the liberty of compiling a few clips from it to put on my website.</p>
